# Accountability - YC sprint check-in - 2023 - Before launch

## 2023-03-19 - 2023-03-25

### What's holding you back from moving faster ?

- Not putting in the time

- Why?
  - Not waking up on time, so missing the "2 hour 6-8am morning work period", and this also messes up the rest of the routine in the day
  - Been procrastinating, by going out alot with Dad, Shyam, and people -- so end up been randomly/aimlessly outside during work times (such as the "2 hour 7-9pm evening work period")

### What are your goals for the next week?

- Context:
  - The major thing have to do right now is build MVP & get it in front of users, as quickly as possible

- Need to:
  - Create NixOS ISO for the server, that is stable & reliable
    - Where (roughly) stable & reliable is defined by:
      - Can access it through Lunanode, without downtime
      - Can update the operating system without the system crashing
  - Install & run Penpot on the server that accessible through the browser & internet

### What were your goals for the last week?

- Setting up postgress & postgress connections within the Elixir app -- so that can put & retrieve data into the database from the frontend of the app.
  - Specifically:
    - Wanted to put & retrieve information on "Form Fields" that the user would set up for data collection

#### Did you hit the goals or not?

- Partially:
  - ...

- What learned:
  - There are two parts to setting up the databases:
    - 1. Is the techinical programming aspects
    - 2. Is knowing what {schema, tables, variables, ...}, that need to set up in order to hold & track the data.

##### If you didn't hit them, then what came in the way of hiting your goals?

- Not putting in enough time
- Getting overwhelemed, not managing emotional state -- which led to avoidance behavior & procrastination
- Underestimating the problem
- Problem criteria & what needs to be done changing
  - So for example, went from database connections to "store & retrieve Form Fields", ended up working on database connections to "retrieve project names"
