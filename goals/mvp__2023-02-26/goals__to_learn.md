# Goals - MVP 2023-02-026 - Goals: To learn

## Short term of goals of the MVP

### Launching to self

- Can use the MVP just learn more & experiment, don't even need to publish it publically if uncomfortable on not having a clear sense of direction, and feel that going doing this direction to lead to commitments (even only to self & team) that could take critical time away from learning.
  - For example can launch to self & test out different ideas:
    - *Tracking relationship*
      - Potential connection to "Behavioral Scientists" trying to experiment, test, and iterate in the wild
    - *Tracking fitness progress*
      - Potentially nice connection with the "fitness crowd", who have issues with current solutions
        - Ex:
          - Tracking "progress" pictures & not letting it take over their "albums"
          - Summarizing progressing pictures and sharing it out, or using it as a form of tracking & motivation/progress building
            - Ex:
              - Progress pictures automatically summarized into gifs
    - *Tracking bill payments*
      - Potentially nice connection with "software/tools for ADHD management" market
      - Potentially nice connection with "Excel" powerusers that want "spreadsheets" on the go, and easily/seamlessly intergrate the tools they use customized specifially to their use case
    - *Managing Tomorrow's Gift business through the app, for convience, effort reductin, and time savings*

- Neat thing about "launch to self" is that:
  - Can create & prototype, quickly with self
    - Helping to reduce the "90% of what is in a prototype is wrong" concept
  - Can systematically expand testing to learn about the concepts/issues
    - Ex:
      - If notice that a particular use case is tied to a particular market:
        - Can then:
          - Learn about that market (through online/independent research)
          - Reach out experts to learn about specific problems, whether they encounter them, and how they address them
          - Talk to the experts and/or potential users, showing the prototypes, and conducting rough basic user interviews.
  - Key point is at every test learning with a physical prototype based on areal "user" experience (even it is just me), and expanding systematically from there.

- Would need to make this process/learning focused & tangible with deadlines
  - Maybe make "learning" goals & deadlines.
    - Like:
      - Trying to implement a specific functionality based on a need, and setting clear learning goals with this "prototype", with deadlines -- and systematically building from there

- Need to ask about exact specific value & whether this app was "critical" to achieving what wanted, or whether it helped achieve greater heights
  - Need to quantitively measure & gather proof of value or no value

### Why & how people collect information

- (eventually) Need to understand:
  - What kind of information people collect & why?
  - How they currently collect that information?

### Data based/informed decision making

- Need to understand who most critically needs to make "data based/informed decisions", using real data "in the field"
  - Like convience store owners

### Get data for positioning goals

- What are the "competitive alternatives" that people utilize?
- What is the "unique value" of what want to build?
- Who "cares most about that value"?

## To organize & clarify thoughts

### On "Vision"

- Ideas:
  - "Make it easy for people to {*experiment*, *learn*, & *iterate*} with real life data, in real life contexts'

### On competitive advantage

- Need to think of, and quickly start implementing & testing competitive advantages
  - Especially to:
    - counter against "Tableau" & other big players, since they can easily just release a product that can do this -- and they'd have a bigger reach + ecosystem (with other products/intergrations), that would make it easy for them to corner us out
      - Tableau is especially scary
        - Now even has sophisticated marketing/community building that entrenches it into people's work/lives
          - Ex:
            - Tableau's public social site
              - That kind of direct to "consumer" relationship & intergration into people's lives, can probably help them move very quickly
                - (Keep seeing example of the teenager/young adult found on tableus "social" community page, proudly displaying his work -- that is an example of alot social & behavioral incentives that make Tablaue "cool" & hard to overcome -- Ex: this is cool kid has a cool way to display his skills in a more specific way than Tableau so that he can be hired & earn a higher status among his peers)
    - counter against copy cat startups

- Need to figure out the common causes of why the startups that first innovated on an idea failed -- and other startups after them were able to use the same ideas, but go to much greater heights

### On "positioning"

- Need:
  - Clear definitions of potential "market frame of references" with respect to each customer need (that want to critically target now & (if any quickly to to mind) in the future) & competitive alternative
  - Need to have a plan to systematically test out positioning in this initial phase of gathering evidence by casting a wide "net"
