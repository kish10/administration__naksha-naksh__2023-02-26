# Clear descriptions of what accomplishment & failure to accomplish look like (prioritized in order of importantance, starting with most important)

##Most important element to create:

1. MVP - Form Element (Ability to create arbitrary form elements)
  - Subtasks:
    - Create interface to "create" a form
      - *Accomplishment*:
        - Interface on the web page, that allows users to create a form (with form field data types of: number, text, boolean, (discrete) integer interval (Ex: [-5,5]), categorical
      - *Failure*
        - No web UI that allows users to create a Form that takes those types of measurements as fields

    - Display the form in the "application"
      - *Accomplishment*
        - Form created by the user displayed in the "application" section of the "Data Collection" project
      - *Failure*
        - Not that

    - Store form data in a table in a mock database for unit testing
      - *Accomplishment*:
        - Data inputted through the form in the "Application" section, stored into a mock database for unit testing
        - Automatically add a timestamp field for when the data was inputted
      - *Failure*
        - Not even a data model on the front end side created (the between form data inputted & stored in the data set)
        - No data saved in a temporary "database" for unit testing purposes

2. MVP - Form data display table

    - In "edit" section - UI to hook up to the "form data"

      - *Failure*
        - Not that

    - In "Application" section - Display data as a scrolable list of rows, where each section has the fields & values inputted in the form (input timestamp can be displayed in the corner seperately)

      - *Faliure*
        - Not that

3. Administration - Complete Clerky steps (at least upto "Foreign Qualification"

# Tigers, Paper-Tigers, Elephants

## Tigers

(added Tuesday - 2023-02-28)

1. Motivation

2. Getting lost in "learning Phoenix" & loosing track the goal of creating an MVP by 2023-03-11 (Next week) -- so this week need to work out the key components

## Paper-Tigers

## Elephants

(added Tuesday - 2023-02-28)

1. The scope of the MVP may not be so clear, or that may need to reduce scope
  - Better to reduce scope of the MVP to:
    - "App where "Users can create arbitary forms, that they can use to input/store data at a later date"

# Post-premortem action plan (addressing each Tiger (or Elephant), and each important question/learning point/element that needs to be created

1. Motivation
  - Need to pay attention to, and let go of any source of negativity
  - Noticed that loose motivation through a loss of momentum
    - So if for example, wanting to read the light novels "Death god's daughter with an Ebony sword"
      - Don't start reading it at a time where already motivated
        - Especially when that is not the appropriate time for it in the flow of the schedule
  - Seemed to be getting overwhelmed with things start up / execution related.
    - So can use the light novel strategically here, as it is something that can distract, help let go of those negative emotions, as well as inspire (with the themes of: non-conformism, hard work, and strategically working to be the best at the most impactful/appropriate thing)
