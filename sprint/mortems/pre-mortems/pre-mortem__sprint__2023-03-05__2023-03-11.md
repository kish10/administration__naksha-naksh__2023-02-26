# Pre-mortem - Sprint: 2023-03-05 - 2023-03-11


## What is the most important: question need to answer, thing need to learn, or element that need to create ?

1. MVP - Form Element - UI for user to "create an arbitrary form" within "Edit mode"
2. MVP - Learn Phoenix & Elixir (with focus on MVP creation & rapid prototyping)

3. Administration - Update finances (log all expenses so far & save reciepts)
4. Administration - Organize & backup company documents
5. Administration - Figure out tax deadline & (briefly) look into tax requirements for the company

7. (if time) - NixOS Server ISO - copy config nix files into the server directoy & test updating the server using the config files

## Clear descriptions of what accomplishment & failure to accomplish look like (prioritized in order of importantance, starting with most important)

1. MVP - Form Element - UI for user to "create an arbitrary form" within "Edit mode"
  - *Accomplishment*:
    - Make the button "Add a field" clicklabe (i.e. Call an Elixir function on the server when clicked)
    - Render a non-interactive empty "field" to the UI after the button is clicked
    - Manually do TDD for the feature "users can create an arbitrary form"
    - (if time) Get "empty field" information from Ecto
  - *Failure*:
    - Not making a button that interacts with "phx-click"
    - Not specifying basic TDD tests for the feature "users can create an arbitrary form"

2. MVP - Learn Phoenix & Elixir (with focus on MVP creation & rapid prototyping)
  - *Accomplishment*
    - Understand Phoenix directory structure, especially in relation to:
      - The "Elixir" application
      - Using key macros (such as config)
      - The use of atoms to set environment variables
      - Contexts & modules
    - Understand how to test Phoenix applications
      - How Ecto sandboxes run
      - How test files are identified & ran
    - The request-life-cycle in relation to "phx-" events (so a use it for the button click)
    - (if time) How to use Ecto

3. Administration - Update finances (log all expenses so far & save reciepts)
4. Administration - Organize & backup company documents
5. Administration - Figure out tax deadline & (briefly) look into tax requirements for the company

7. (if time) - NixOS Server ISO - copy config nix files into the server directoy & test updating the server using the config files

## Tigers, Paper-Tigers, Elephants
## Post-premortem action plan (addressing each Tiger (or Elephant), and each important question/learning point/element that needs to be created
