# Post mortem - Sprint: 2023-02-26 - 2023-03-04

## What happened last sprint:
### What planned to do

1. MVP - Form Element
2. MVP - Form data display table
3. Administration - Complete Clerky steps (at least upto "Foreign Qualification"
4. Administration - Apply for NC "Foreign Qualification"
5. Administration - Update Naksha financial transactions
6. Administration - Spend atleast 30mins on "Trademarks" checklist
7. (if time) MVP - user accounts & authentication

### What did do

1. MVP - Form Element
  - Parts did:
    - Basic paper prototype of the UI that users can use to "create an arbitrary form"
    - Basic non-interactive implementation of the UI in HTML generated through Elixir/Phoenix

3. Administration - Complete Clerky steps (at least upto "Foreign Qualification"
  - Did all Clerky "Post Incorporation" steps upto creating a bank account
4. Administration - Apply for NC "Foreign Qualification"
6. Administration - Spend atleast 30mins on "Trademarks" checklist
  - Parts did:
    - Briefly researched Trademarks in US, did not get to "exact steps in how to register a Trademark", but found good resources that should be able to help

### What did not do

1. MVP - Form Element
  - Parts did not do:
    - Form creation (in "Edit" mode):
      - Only created a paper prototype, but not working prototype where users can actually create an arbitrary form that is persisted for "Form input" in the data collection stage
    - Form input (in "Application" mode):
      - No prototypes for where a user can input data using the form
2. MVP - Form data display table
7. (if time) MVP - user accounts & authentication

## Why did not do what planned to do

1. Phoenix & Elixir, turned out to be more complicated than expected
  - Initially struggled to understand why struggling
    - Did not understand:
      - The implication of "client-side" vs "server-side" in terms of how conceptualize & implement code
        - Since used to doing things "client-side" with JS, kept hitting conceptual blocks of try to approach development through "client-side" perspective
          - Needed to first realize this difference, then adjust the approach
        - Example issues:
          - How buttons work:
            - In "client-side" JS, have the "on-click" attributes that can put add to buttons, that would call a client-side JS function.
              - So needed to realize that in regular html buttons don't have "on-click"
                - Then translate that to the Phoenix equivalent:
                  - "phx-click" that would call a function on the "server-side" code
                  - Or trying to understand "client-side" interaction through `Phoenix LiveView` JS module
      - The difference between JS & Elixir
        - Elixir being a functional programming language doesn't have the same approach to data persistance that JS has
          - So unlike "client-side" JS, can't simply have a list that can use to track data to be rendered.
            - Persited data is actually mostly through Ecto
            - & there isn't a variable that can reference & updated during runtime, like a class variable in "object-oriented" programming
  - Phoenix is complicated with all it's configurations & files
  - With Phoenix (seems like) have to use Ecto for Data persistance
    - But this just adds an extra step of database set up
      - So it becomes like juggling too many things at once
  - Elixir is somewhat complicated to due it's design & distributed/functional nature
    - For example:
      - Struggling with the concept of "Elixir Application"
        - This led to alot of "magic"/"black box" type code
        - Then when there was alot of this (like many files & configurations), got overwhelmed

2. Getting overwhelmed

## What went well

1. Still continuing to push on despite difficulties & getting overwhelmed -- still came to desk & worked, even when felt depressed & thought wouldn't be able to make it to the desk/work

2. Using checklists to track the tasks
  - It was good to have the grounded focus of "what trying to do?", "Want to meet MVP deadline, so what have to do right now?"
  - Then adding to that, it was also good to add status updates into the checklist
    - This helped track what did & why, where got stuck & what trying to do about it, and next steps
    - This also helped "grounding" the work, since everytime came to the checklist got exposed to the context of "what need to do right now & why?"

3. Breaking the sprint tasks down -- could be better (since for example broke tasks down during the sprint), but good to see even a little progress on this, as it helped do more focused/targeted work.

4. Proportioning & roughly scheduling the sprint tasks
  - This helped to counter against the phenomenom where one tasks ends up taking the whole time, and so other important tasks are not addressed.

## What was the most important thing (wanted) to do/learn last sprint?

1. MVP - Form Element
2. MVP - Form data display table
3. Administration - Complete Clerky steps (at least upto "Foreign Qualification"
4. Administration - Apply for NC "Foreign Qualification"
5. Administration - Update Naksha financial transactions

## What did & learned inorder to address that (the important thing)?

### For 1 & 2 (MVP creation)

What did:
- Created a paper-protype to think through concepts
- Kept breaking the tasks down in order to focus on the smaller component that need to work on "right now"
- Implement non-interactive version of the "user can create an arbitrary form" UI in HTML through Phoenix -- this helped to focus & learn phoenix in a way that goes toward prototype creation

What learned:
- Better understand of the smaller parts that make up the "Form Element" UI
  - Parts:
    - Form creation (in "Edit" mode)
    - Form display for data input (in "Application" mode)

### For 3,4,5 (Adminstrative tasks)

(Did not work on 5)

What did:
- Made a point to stick to "Thursday evening Administration work" theme that have been using for the past couple of sprints
  - This helped make time for this
  - This helped know exactly what to do, and get it done
- When through all the "Post Incorporation" Clerky steps, except the last one "Create a bank account"
- Applied for EIN with the IRS for the business
- Registered for "Foriegn Qualification" with NC
- Breifly looked into & learned about Trademarks

## How the reality compares against the pre-mortem document?

Note:
- Pre-mortem document was done during the sprint (maybe around Wednesday)

- Motivation & getting lost "learning Phoenix" were declared as "Tigers" in the pre-mortem
  - Nice thing however is that:
    - Did fight motivation to some extent, at least turned 0 situations to alteast "1 hour" situations
      - Pre-planning for disruption & reduced hours did help with motivation, since motivation problems weren't in the negative sense "not doing work that supposed to do", but in the positive sense "going beyond the minimum schedule for bonus work"
    - Kept "grounding" "learning Phoenix" with "need to create" MVP, so "learning Phoenix", was more focused in a sense.

### What were the items in the pre-mortem document?

#### Tigers

(added Tuesday - 2023-02-28)

1. Motivation

2. Getting lost in "learning Phoenix" & loosing track the goal of creating an MVP by 2023-03-11 (Next week) -- so this week need to work out the key components

#### Paper-Tigers

#### Elephants

(added Tuesday - 2023-02-28)

1. The scope of the MVP may not be so clear, or that may need to reduce scope
  - Better to reduce scope of the MVP to:
    - "App where "Users can create arbitary forms, that they can use to input/store data at a later date"

### What were the action items?

#### Action plan from the pre-mortem document

1. Motivation
  - Need to pay attention to, and let go of any source of negativity
  - Noticed that loose motivation through a loss of momentum
    - So if for example, wanting to read the light novels "Death god's daughter with an Ebony sword"
      - Don't start reading it at a time where already motivated
        - Especially when that is not the appropriate time for it in the flow of the schedule
  - Seemed to be getting overwhelmed with things start up / execution related.
    - So can use the light novel strategically here, as it is something that can distract, help let go of those negative emotions, as well as inspire (with the themes of: non-conformism, hard work, and strategically working to be the best at the most impactful/appropriate thing)

### How were the action items addressed during the sprint?

1. Motivation
  - Did make a point of letting go of negativity, and focusing on what have to do & why, and the joy/wonder/awesomeness of it
  - Did make a point of using "read light novel" strategically
    - Used it & other nice activities like "eating spring rolls" to calm down when overwhelmed, and "reset" mindset
  - Did make a point of trying not to destroy momentum.
    - Made a point of trying not to disrupt periods of when working smoothly

### What parts of the pre-mortem document successfully countered against?

#### Tigers

- Motivation (like mentioned earlier)
- "learning phoenix" -- to the extent mentioned earlier -- did get overwhelmed, did get lost, but still was grounded even if a little

#### Elephants

1. The scope of the MVP may not be so clear, or that may need to reduce scope
  - By constantly trying to focus on "what needs to be done right now & why", did continue to break down the MVP into smaller pieces that can focus on to work on right now
  - It helped that have specific MVP specification, and deadline for when need/want to complete MVP by.
    - This keeps propeling & pushing the question, of what can we do now? how can we get there?


### What parts of the pre-mortem did not successfully counter against?
#### Why?

## Brief advice for the future

- Utilize Dan Pink's finding of middles.
  - Seems like the "Agile" methodology doesn't work for this kind of "startup prototyping", just like how Dylan says it doesn't work for "Data Science"
    - So can instead plan differently, for example using the idea of "a middle" to:
      - Split the sprint into two
      - Figure out what's working & what isn't
      - Make decisions on the next steps

- Reduce scope of what want to/have to do in a Sprint
  - Together with using "middle"s:
    - Plan for the main work to be done by Wednesday, and the rest of the week, after adjusting for what learned in first half: either buffer period, or next steps
