## Why did not do what planned to do

- Reasons for why did not do {3,4,5} (the administration tasks):
  1. Motivation
    - Lost motivation, discipline, and energy on Thursday evening when planned to do these tasks.
      - *Why lost motivation, discipline, and energy?*:
        1. Mind & body got filled up with negativity that accumulated over the week
          - Negativity from:
            - Work - not being/feeling good enough there, and few negative related interactions
            - D feeling terrible & towards ending
            - M & D arguing
            - Thinking how don't have a normal life -- feeling jelous about the Lily executive saw at the store with the pretty wife & baby -- wishing & fantasizing about what it would be to have that life
            - Feeling negative about self
  2. Time
    - Didn't work with discipline, so even the limited time had was reduced.
    - Ran out of time to make up the lack of disciple, especially on Thursady

- Reason for 7:
  - That was a bonus!

## What went well

- Reducing scope
- Using the concept of "middle", and planning in a flexible way upto wednesday
- Focusing on "what needs to be done & why?" with building the MVP
  - That groundedness helped
- Working to remove negativity
  - Even though could have a done a better job, it is amazing that despite all the negativity that happened, which would have a destroyed {weeks, months, years}, in this week: did keep focus, did successfully reduce negativity upto a point -- and did achieve what set out to do with the MVP!
  - Should focus on continuing to do this -- it has tremendous, amazing benefits

## What was the most important thing (wanted) to do/learn last sprint?

- Creating the MVP:
  1. MVP - Form Element - UI for user to "create an arbitrary form" within "Edit mode"
  2. MVP - Learn Phoenix & Elixir (with focus on MVP creation & rapid prototyping)

## What did & learned inorder to address that (the important thing)?


## How the reality compares against the pre-mortem document?

### What were the items in the pre-mortem document?

### What were the action items?

### How were the action items addressed during the sprint?

### What parts of the pre-mortem document successfully countered against?

### What parts of the pre-mortem did not successfully counter against?

#### Why?


## Brief advice for the future

1. Continue with "fanatic discipline" to let go of any source of negativity -- negativity doesn't help to move forward, focusing, and solve the problem in way
  - Note: Constructive critism doesn't count as negativity

2. Moving forward (at least for now), start with picking ONLY one thing to do/learn during the week -- then only focus on that for the first half of the week until Wednesday.
  - Make Thursday morning a review period
    - Review the status of the project & goals, review the status of the sprint & goals

3. Need to go back to being fantically disciplined about spending quality time working during the specificed time periods
  - Such as: 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the evening
