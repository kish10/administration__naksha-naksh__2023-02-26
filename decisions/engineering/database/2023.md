Deciding to use `Postgress` instead of `sqlite`
- Since:
  - Even though would be able to get up & running with `sqlite` quickly at the end of the day `Postgress` is a database that is more intentionally designed & used as a production database
    - A pointed out in [SQLite Docs - Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html):
      - A Client/Server RDMS database would work better than SQLite for:
        - Applications with 'many client programs sending SQL to the same dtabase over a network'
          - Which is true based on the needs/design of this app, and because of how working with Elixir/Phoenix
        - High Concurrency
          - 'SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but it will only allow one writer at any instance in time.'
  - If start out with `Postgress` then don't have to migrate from sqlite to `Postgress` in the future
  - Postgress like SQLite also doesn't use as much resources (apparently)
